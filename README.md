### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The months with the greatest number of successful campaigns launched in May and June. Overall, most successful campaigns had launch dates between April and August, and December was the most difficult month to launch.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
Highest percentage of most successful campaigns had funding goals of less than $5,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This data does not take into account how much funds were pledged to successful campaigns. 

## Results
This dataset is limited as it does not account for how much pledged funding successful campaigns received. Did the level of additional pledged funds above the goal impact successful campaigns that launched April â€“ August? Recommend a line graph to further explore if there is a relationship between the funding pledged and number of successful campaigns based on launch date.
